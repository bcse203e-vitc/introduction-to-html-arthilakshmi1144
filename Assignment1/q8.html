    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first paragraph. It is indented using four non-breaking spaces. You can increase the indentation by adding more <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> entities if needed. This paragraph demonstrates how to manually control indentation without using CSS.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second paragraph. Like the first one, it begins with four <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> characters to create an indent. While not semantically ideal for layout control, it works in simple HTML contexts where CSS may not be available or allowed.</p>
